### DOWNLOAD THE ORIGINAL MNIST DATASET

I used the following link to download a .csv represetnation of the original MNIST dataset, but feel free to use whatever source you find.

The most important element is that the first column in the numeric label {0,9} and the rest of the array is the flattened row-wise representation of the image.

In order to reproduce the results found in this repo, preserve the train/test split provided by the MNIST data set and simply point the jupyter notebook MNIST_MultiRocket.ipynb to your dataset.
